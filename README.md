# Georgia Tech EAS Glacier and Ice Sheet Dynamics Labs 

In this repository, we adapt and create lab exercises based on materials developed by [OGGM-Edu](https://edu.oggm.org) [(tutorials here)]([https://oggm.org/tutorials/stable/notebooks/welcome.html]) to examine ice dynamics in an OGGM / MyBinder environment.
